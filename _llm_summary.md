# LLM Project Summary: shoyo-hostable

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

**shoyo-hostable** is a self-hostable version of the [shoyo.work](https://shoyo.work) service â€” a developer-focused portfolio platform akin to Linktr.ee. This project allows developers to deploy their portfolio using Docker, showcasing their work with just two variables:

- `PAGE_UID` â€” Identifier for the page to display
- `PUBLIC_KEY` â€” Key used to validate or display page content

This app renders a React-based frontend and pulls developer profile and link data from the Shoyo API using the above values.

## ðŸ“š Documentation Expectations

LLM tooling should look for and optionally generate the following documentation sections:

* `README.md`: Project overview, installation, variables, deployment
* `Dockerfile`: Self-hosting usage, exposed ports, runtime details
* `src/`: Component-level documentation for React (e.g. props, lifecycle)
* `scripts/`: DevOps or deployment automation
* `public/`: Static entry point (single-page app bootstrapping)
* `.github/workflows/`: CI/CD integration for DockerHub
* `.env` or `example.env`: Required environment variables

---

## ðŸ§  LLM Metadata & Goals

**Goal for LLMs:**

* Help generate accurate developer docs
* Assist in writing contribution guides
* Build or suggest tests based on component and deployment logic
* Summarize CI/CD logic from workflows
* Identify where environment configuration is used (`process.env`)
* Classify and explain role of each file/folder for onboarding

---

## ðŸš¦ Environment Variables

LLMs should reference `example.env` and document:

* `PAGE_UID` â€” required
* `PUBLIC_KEY` â€” required

These are read by the React app via `process.env` and injected at build/runtime.

---

## ðŸ§ª Potential LLM Tasks

* Summarize all components under `src/`
* Generate flow diagrams (API â†’ React â†’ Render)
* Extract all used environment variables
* Document how to deploy using Docker
* Suggest validations for input fields in UI
* Recommend test cases for `src/index.jsx`
* Propose auto-documentation from `package.json` scripts
* Help generate JSON schema for configuration
